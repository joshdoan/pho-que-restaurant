            <h2>Our Policies</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Pho Que! We strive to provide not only delicious food, but also a transparent and respectful experience for every guest. <br>
            Please review the following policies regarding privacy, service, refunds, and more. <br>
            By using our services — whether in person or online — you agree to the terms listed below.</p>

            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us. When you place an order, make a reservation, or contact us, we may collect information such as your name, email address, phone number, and delivery location. <br>
            This information is used solely for operational purposes — to complete orders, communicate with you, or improve our service. <br>
            We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties except as required by law or when necessary to complete a transaction (e.g., delivery through a third-party platform). <br>
            We use secure technologies to store and manage your data. <br>
            If you wish to update or delete your data, please contact us, and we will respond promptly in accordance with applicable privacy laws.</p>

            <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
            <p>At Pho Que, we prepare every dish with care. Once an order is placed, it is considered final and cannot be canceled through our website or by third-party apps.<br>
            However, if there is a mistake with your order (e.g., missing items, incorrect dishes, quality concerns), please notify us within 30 minutes of pickup or delivery. <br>
            We will investigate the issue and may offer a refund, remake, or credit depending on the nature of the situation. Proof of the issue (e.g., a photo) may be requested. <br>    
            Please note we cannot offer refunds due to personal taste preferences or because of incorrect order placement on the customer’s part.</p>

            <h1>Allergy & Dietary Notice</h1>
            <p>We understand the importance of dietary restrictions and do our best to accommodate allergies and preferences. <br>
            That said, our kitchen handles a variety of ingredients including peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, soy, gluten, dairy, and eggs.<br>
            We cannot guarantee that any menu item is completely free of allergens. Cross-contact is possible despite careful preparation. <br>
            If you have a serious allergy, please inform our staff before ordering, and proceed with caution when dining with us.</p>

            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">By visiting our website or placing an order (either directly or via delivery platforms), you agree to:</p>
            <li>Provide accurate contact and delivery information</li>
            <li>Treat our staff respectfully and courteously</li>
            <li>Not engage in fraudulent activity or attempt to reverse payments without cause</li>
            <li>Accept our stated refund and allergy disclaimers</li>
            <p>We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for inappropriate behavior, repeated policy violations, or safety concerns.<br>
            We may update these terms periodically. Continued use of our services implies acceptance of the most current version.</p>

            <h1>Third-Party Delivery Services</h1>
            <p>If you use Grubhub, DoorDash, Uber Eats, or any other delivery app to order from us, please understand that their policies may apply in addition to ours. <br>
            We are not responsible for delays, incorrect delivery addresses, or payment issues that occur through these third-party services.<br>
            For the best experience, we recommend reviewing the delivery platform’s refund, delivery, and support policies before placing your order.</p>

            <h1>Online Ordering & Account Information</h1>
            <p>When placing orders through our website, you are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of your cart, address, and contact details. <br>
            We are not responsible for orders placed incorrectly or deliveries made to wrong addresses due to input errors.</p><br>
